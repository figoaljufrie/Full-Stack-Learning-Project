-- Document Object Model (DOM) --
A way to interact with and manipulate web pages.
Web as a document, the DOM is a tool that allows you to:
- Change
- Read
- Update
The contents of that document (web page) using JavaScript.

Key points:
- Document: Your web pages, includes everything you see on a webpage (text, images, links, buttons, forms, etc).

- Object: A containers for data and actions. DOM represents your web page as a structured set of objects that you can manipulate.

- Model: A way to represents the structure of your web page in a logical and organized manner. This model is hierarchical, where elements (paragraphs, headings, images, etc) are related to one another.

-- Intro to REACT --
An Open-source JavaScript Library developed by Facebook. Primarily used for building User Interfaces (UI) and handling the view layer of web applicatinos.

React allows developers to create reusable UI Components and efficiently manage the state of a web application. It makes it easier to build interactive, dynamic, and scalable front-end applications. 

-- WHY REACT? --

Due to:
- Flexibility
- Performance
- Developer-friendly approach
in building modern web applications. It is widely used in web development for creating:

- Single-page applications
- Progressive web apps
- Complex user interfaces across various industries & platforms

In a way, react are:
- Component-based architecture
- Declarative Programming
- Efficient Virtual DOM
- Reusability & Compatibility
- Rich Ecosystem
- Large & Active Community
- Backed by Facebook
- Platform Agnostic (Can be used for web development as well as mobile app development <React Native>. Allows developers to reuse a significant portions of their codebase while building applications for multiple platforms.)
- OPEN SOURCE & FREEEEEEE

-- SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS (SPA) --
A method to update the appearance without having to refresh the entire appearance of the website. So it only uses an HTML file as a media render.

Considered better because of it's rendering speed. Because only certain elements/components are updated without having to reload the entire page by utilizing Virtual DOM. 

-- Virtual DOM in React --
A lightweight, in-memory representations of the actual DOM of a web page. It acts as an intermediary layer between your React components and the real DOM.

React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize updates and imporve performance by reducing direct manipulation of the real DOM.

Virtual DOM allows react to efficiently track and update only the elements that have changed, minimizing th ework required to keep the web page up to date. This results in faster rendering and a smoother user experience (UX).

<---------------------------------------------------->
-- Next.JS --
Open-source JavaScript Framework that simplifies the development of React-based web applications. Developed and maintained by Vercel, Next.Js extends the capabilities of React by adding Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and other powerful features.
