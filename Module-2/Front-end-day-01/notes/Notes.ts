Notes;
Everytime you visit a website, everything:
- You can see
- You can click
- You can use

are the work of a front-end dev.

Front-End is the development of code that creates the visual elemengs of a website, software, or apps. Some of the front-end languages includes:
- HTML (Defines the content of web pages)
- CSS (Specifies the layout of web pages)
- JS (Programs the beahviour of web pages)

The following orders are:
1. Create the structure with HTML

2. Style and/or customize the elements using CSS

3. Make it work and/or interactive with Javascript.

BASIC TO HTML Docs:

- <!DOCTYPE> : Defines the document type and HTML Version

- <html> : Encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises of document header which is represented by:
<head> </head>
and document body which is represented by:
<body> </body>

- <title>: Is used inside the <head> tag to mention the document title.

- <body>: This tad represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags like <h>, <div>, <p>, <mark>, <strong>, etc.

HTML FUNDAMENTAL:
1. Opening Tag: Define the name of the elements (<p> ex.) wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets.

2. Closing Tag: Includes a forward slash before the element name. This tag places in the end of elements. </p>

3. Content: Places between the opening & closing tags. In this case, content written as a text.

4. Element: The Opening, Closing, and The content together comprise the elements.

<-------------------------------------------->
SEMANTIC IN HTML:
Using HTML Tags that describe the meaning of the content, not just how it looks.

Examples of Semantic Tags (With Meaning):
<header> Top of a page or section, usually contains logo, nav, title. </header>

<nav> Navigation links (menu, sidebar links) </nav>

<main> The main contect of your page (1per page)</main>

<section> A logical grouping of content (e.g, Hero, Blog, Features, etc)

<article> A stand-alone piece of content (e.g, blog post, card) </article>

<aside> Side content (ads, widgets, sidebards, etc) </aside>

<footer> Bottom of Page or section, usually with copyright, links </footer>

<figure> An image or media with caption </figure>

<figcaption> Caption for an image/figure </figcaption>

<div> Is a generic box. Use it when you just need a layout wrapper or if you DONT HAVE A BETTER WAY TO DESCRIBE WHAT INSIDE YOUR CODE IS </div>
